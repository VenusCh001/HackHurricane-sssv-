## How AmbuTrack Addresses the Problem

Currently, emergency calls involve manual coordination, leading to potential delays. **AmbuTrack** addresses this by providing a user-friendly platform for quick ambulance bookings, minimizing response time and providing real time location tracking of ambulance drivers.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Implementing a robust real-time tracking system posed challenges. We overcame this by integrating advanced mapping technologies to ensure accurate ambulance location updates.
